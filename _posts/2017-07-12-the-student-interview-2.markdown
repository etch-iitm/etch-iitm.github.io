> Manavala Thambi was the Branch Counselor of the Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering for the academic year 2016-17. He went to University of Seoul for a semester exchange in his fourth semester (Jan-May 2015). Thambi shares his perspective and experience in this interview. 

### What is the procedure that one should follow while applying for semester exchange?
I wanted to take up an exchange in the fourth semester so I started working on it in the beginning of third semester. I spoke with the Liaison Officer (Office of International Relations), letting him know that I am interested in taking up exchange programs. I even spoke to one of my seniors who went for a semester exchange. He guided me throughout the process.

The guidelines are as follows: you look at all the colleges you are interested in. IITM already has a lot of MOUs with various institutes across the world. You can look into those and choose one from them. If you are interested in any other institute you can make a note of it and inform the Liaison officer. He will contact the university and let you know if you can go for a semester exchange to that institute. After that, the corresponding international college will send us a nomination form. Our institute will nominate a few students. From there on, our institute does not involve in the conversations between the students and the college. The college will send us applications and we need to fill them before the deadlines. 

The most important aspects are student’s CGPA and the Statement of purpose(SoP). In some cases the institute itself chooses whom they should send, so in such cases CGPA is the determining factor.


### Tell us more about the experience of taking up a semester exchange program at Seoul National University? 

Through exchange programs, you get to go to a new country and understand their culture. You also get to know how the same department functions in the other country and institute. It was good how I got to know how the education system works in South Korea. It’s interesting how the Indian system and South Korean system are not very different.

### Could you elaborate a bit on the similarities and differences between the educational system here and in South Korea?

They’re quite similar. The pattern of exams is same, as in how one needs to take up an entrance exam after school and then they get into college. Also, just like how we have IITs they have a few premier institutes whose admissions are based on such an exam. This means that even they work hard in their school days to get into a good institute. 
However, I think the difference arises in how they have a better perception of what subject they need to choose. Here we generally take up courses like CS, Elec or Mech because of “popularity”. They actually put some thought into choosing courses they like.

### Did you face any challenges while at SNU?
Not really; the institute made it very simple for us. Food and language could be the only potential issues, but I personally had no problem. We had Google Translate for the language issue. Also, since I am a non-vegetarian, I was able to cope up with the food. 

### How has the exchange program helped you personally and professionally?
Be it personal and professional, it’s all interlinked. I got to know a lot of people there, that means I currently know a lot of people all around the world. If I plan to go anywhere I can take their help anytime, and similarly, if they want to come to India I will be there to help them out. This builds your network and it is the biggest take away you get from an exchange program.

### Do have any advice for those applying for semester exchange now and those who will be applying in future?
When you are looking for exchange programs, check the semester timings of the institute you wish to go to. In some cases the semester timings may be different and will not match with our timings. When you take the courses there you will also have to make sure that you complete your requirements here. For example if you have Physical Metallurgy here as a core course, you can take the same course there, but you have to make sure that you inform your faculty advisor and get the approval.

### How would you like to describe your stay at IITM? What have you learnt from insti, the department and the people over here?
It’s been great being at IIT Madras, overall. Though I am not going to be pursuing a career in MME, I’m sure it’s great for those who are interested. Generally, our department is quite jovial to its students if you any problem you can always talk to any of the professors; they are ready to help you. Also, the leadership skills one develops through co-curricular and extracurricular activities in the institute is certainly very useful. Sports, again, is a vibrant fraternity. If you are into sports, IITM is one of the best places to develop your skills. I am happy I got such an experience.

### Any words of encouragement or suggestions to your juniors?
I would say that even if you have an interest in something, however slight you think it is, always pursue it. Being in IITM, you have a lot of opportunities and experienced people to help you out, so utilise them.
