>  Varun Sridhar is a Dual Degree student of the Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering in our institute. In this interview, he talks about his experience of his semester-long exchange at the EPFL university in Switzerland, which he undertook in his fourth semester (Jan-May 2016)

### How was your semester abroad experience?

Despite some difficulties, it was an excellent experience -- I met people from a variety of backgrounds, cultures and disciplines; I was exposed to a new method of course instruction, one that granted students considerably more academic freedom than in IIT and placed emphasis on self-study.  
 
However, I did face difficulties in academics. There weren't many courses in Metallurgical and Materials Engineering (MME) at the 2nd year level that were taught in English. EPFL (École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne) is located in Lausanne, in the French speaking part of Switzerland, and so the language of instruction for undergraduate programs is French.
I was forced to opt for graduate level courses that were far beyond my abilities as a 4th semester MME student. I would advise students to consider EPFL for a semester abroad only in the 4th year, since students will have the prerequisites to be able to attend most graduate level courses, almost all of which are taught in English.

### How does one start the application process?

If you’re considering a semester abroad, I would recommend going to the Office of International Relations, OIR, and meeting the institute’s liaison officer, immediately. He will be able to give you a comprehensive explanation of how the application process works in universities abroad, and be able to put you in touch with students who’ve been to universities you’re considering.  

### Okay, so does it matter if one is a B.Tech or a Dual Degree student when applying for an exchange?

In my opinion, a semester exchange program will be easier to do for Dual Degree students. The semester abroad is about more than just coursework; you should also have time to travel and explore the country. The additional year Dual Degree students have in insti will give them time to make up for any insti courses that they miss when on a semester abroad.
 
### How does course mapping work? Why is it so important?

Course mapping is essentially matching courses that you need to compulsorily do in IITM during the semester that you’re going to be away, with courses offered by the host university during the same semester. If you can’t effectively match courses, ensure that you have time after you’re back in the institute to do any compulsory course that you couldn’t match, since you won’t be able to graduate without doing them.  
 
### So, from what you say, your faculty advisor and the liaison officer seem to be the most important people from the institute to talk to before applying, is that right?
 
The liaison officer is the best person to speak to for information on available exchange programs. Speaking to your faculty advisor before applying is essential. You will need his/her approval at several steps along the way. If he/she is not available, the Head of the Department’s approval is accepted. The liaison officer will be able to explain further.
 
Although not compulsory (from my knowledge; I don’t know if the process has changed since my 2nd year), I would strongly advise informing the Dean AC (Academic Courses) before making a decision on whether to go on a semester abroad.   
 
### Did you apply anywhere else?

I applied to Czech Technological University in Prague and EPFL in Lausanne. Students from metallurgy in the past have gone to Seoul National University in Korea.
